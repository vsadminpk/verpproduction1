This includes providing accurate and complete responses to questions asked of you by us within 2 weeks.  Inaccurate, incomplete, or late information could have a material effect on our services and/or our conclusions and may result in additional fees. We will not verify the underlying accuracy or completeness of information you provide to us.<br><br>3.3 You are also required to advise us on a timely basis if there are any changes to your circumstances that may be relevant to the performance of our services.  Specifically, if any subsequent event results in the information you provided to us being inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading, then you are obliged to advise us as soon as possible.  We take no responsibility to the extent that our advice is inaccurate, incomplete or misleading because it is based on inaccurate, incomplete or misleading information being provided to us.<br><br>3.4 By accepting the terms of this letter, you will be taken to have agreed that the performance of our services is dependent on the performance of your obligations relating to disclosure and record keeping.<br><br>3.5 The Taxation Administration Act 1953 contains specific provisions that may provide you with \\u201csafe harbours\\u201d from administrative penalties for incorrect or late lodgement of returns if, amongst other things, you give us \\u201call relevant taxation information\\u201d in a timely manner (the safe harbour provisions apply from 1 March 2010).  Accordingly, it is to your advantage that all relevant information is disclosed to us as any failure by you to provide this information may affect your ability to rely on the \\u201csafe harbour\\u201d provisions and will be taken into account in determining the extent to which we have discharged our obligations to you.<br><br>3.6 You are also required to advise us if you become aware of any conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest.  Generally, a conflict of interest is any event which may result in us becoming unable to remain objective in the performance of our services to you. Some examples of events which could give rise to a conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest during this engagement are changes to your business circumstances, events affecting your family (e.g. death and/or marriage breakdown) or a legal action commencing against you.<br><br><br></p>\\n<h5>4 Your rights and obligations under the taxation laws</h5>\\n<p><br>4.1 You have certain rights under the taxation laws, including the right to seek a private ruling from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) or to appeal or object against a decision made by the Commissioner. As relevant, we will provide further information to you concerning your rights under the Australian taxation laws during the conduct of the engagement contemplated by this letter.<br><br>4.2 You also have certain obligations under the Australian taxation laws, such as the obligation to keep proper records and the obligation to lodge returns by the due date.<br><br>4.3 As part of our services, we will keep you informed of any specific rights and obligations that may arise for you under the Australian taxation laws.<br><br><br></p>\\n<h5>5 Trust Account<br><br></h5>\\n<p>5.1 We maintain a separate trust account for dealing with all money and property received from you or on your behalf, except for amounts received from you in payment of our fees. We may apply these funds in payment of our bill with your written authorization.<br><br><br></p>\\n<h5>6 Our obligation to comply with the law<br><br></h5>\\n<p>6.1 We have a duty to act in your best interests. However, the duty to act in your best interests is subject to an overriding obligation to comply with the law even if that may require us to act in a manner that may be contrary to your interests.  For example, we could not lodge an income tax return for you that we knew to be false in a material respect.<br><br>We also have an obligation to ensure that we manage conflicts of interest as they arise. In this regard, we have arrangements in place to ensure that we manage potential or actual conflicts of interest. The effective operation of these arrangements depends, in part, on you complying with your obligation to disclose any potential conflicts of interest to us (see section 3 above).\\nUnless otherwise stated, this opinion is based on the Australian tax law in force and the practice of the Australian Taxation Office (the ATO) applicable as at the date of this letter. <br><br>Our advice and/or services will be based on Australian taxation law in force at the date of the provision of the advice and/or services.  It is your responsibility to seek updated advice if you intend to rely on our advice at a later stage.  We note that Australian taxation laws are often subject to frequent change and our advice will not be updated unless specifically requested by you at the time of the change in law or announced change in law. </p><h5><br><br><br>7 Confidentiality</h5><p><br>We will not disclose any information relating to your affairs to any third party without your consent, unless required by law.  You may provide us with permission to disclose your confidential information in certain circumstances, or place conditions on the disclosure of certain confidential information.  If you do so, we will have permission to disclose the relevant information accordingly, in the performance of our services, unless you instruct us otherwise in writing.</p><h5><br><br><br>8 Fees<br><br></h5><p>8.1 We charge by reference to the time we spend on your matter.
